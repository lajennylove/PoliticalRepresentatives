# Canadian Policital Representative
## Get your political representatives in Canada by your postal code


![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)

This project was created to help people to know their own representatives by their postal codes. The only thing that you have to do is put your postal code in the input field and click on submit, that is going to show you the list of the current wants and some other information like:

- District
- Photograpy
- Name
- Email

## Features

- It was made in HTML5.
- We use Foundation Zurb as the Styling framework.
- And we also used JQuery.

All the infromation is retrieved from the [OpenNorth's](https://represent.opennorth.ca) free API.

We use a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - awesome web-based text editor
- [Foundation Zurb](https://get.foundation) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [jQuery] - Nothing else to explain.

And of course this website itself is open source with a public repository
 on GitHub.
